# `sjml-sdk`

`sjml-sdk` is the Rust guest API for Somuch Java Mod Loader (SJML). Its Rust
crate name is `sjml`; guest projects normally depend on it like this:

```toml
[dependencies]
sjml-sdk = "0.40.0"
```

SJML guests target `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. The SDK also builds natively so
guest logic and data types can be tested, but native builds do not provide the
host imports or WebAssembly callback exports.

```rust
use sjml::prelude::*;

#[mod_init]
fn initialize() -> SjmlResult<()> {
    host::log(LogLevel::Info, "guest initialized")?;
    Ok(())
}
```

See the [SDK guide](https://github.com/SomSomovich/sjml-cli/blob/master/docs/SDK_GUIDE.md)
for callback macros, API modules, capability requirements, bounds, and examples;
the [docs.rs API reference](https://docs.rs/sjml-sdk/0.40.0/sjml/) lists the
public Rust types and functions. The [ABI v1 specification](https://github.com/SomSomovich/sjml-cli/blob/master/docs/ABI.md)
describes the raw WebAssembly interface. For `sjml.toml`, project layout, and
administrator grants, see the [project configuration guide](https://github.com/SomSomovich/sjml-cli/blob/master/docs/PROJECT_CONFIGURATION.md)
and [manifest schema](https://github.com/SomSomovich/sjml-cli/blob/master/docs/MANIFEST_SCHEMA.md).

The full workspace and command-line tool are in the
[sjml-cli repository](https://github.com/SomSomovich/sjml-cli).
